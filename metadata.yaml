description: 'A historic collection of perceptive tales from a luminary of nineteenth-century
  literature First published in 1904, The Heart of Happy Hollow features sixteen short
  stories that provide rare glimpses into the lives of African Americans after the
  Civil War. Through characters ranging from schemers to preachers, Paul Laurence
  Dunbar crafted a rare snapshot of long-lost communities and their poignant sensibilities.
  An author who achieved remarkable versatility, he draws on language that is by turns
  folksy and formal, putting forth controversial vernacular dialects as easily as
  he delivers a hauntingly poetic scene. In this collection, readers meet an influential
  entrepreneur who must navigate a treacherous political landscape; a Southern spiritual
  leader who must learn to accept the mores of his son, who was educated in the North;
  a reporter who restores hope in Santa Claus to a group of destitute siblings; and
  a host of other unique men and women giving voice to timeless themes.Dunbar''s work
  has deservingly experienced a recent revival among commercial and scholarly audiences
  alike, and noted scholar Eleanor Alexander, author of the critically acclaimed biography
  Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow: The Courtship and Marriage of Paul Laurence Dunbar
  and Alice Ruth Moore further contextualizes Dunbar''s contributions to American
  letters. A captivating read, The Heart of Happy Hollow will introduce more book
  lovers to this revered storyteller and visionary.'
